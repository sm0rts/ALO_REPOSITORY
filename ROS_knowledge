This file contains learning takeaways of how to make good ROS code

A node is a unit that does something 
publisher sends information out and a listener recieves it 
The information is sent along channels that have a declared DATATYPE and NAME
Src (source dircetory) contains all the files that make up the project.
A project is therefore declared in the source file (my_robot_controler)
it has project(my_robot_controller),initiation , resource,test directories and package.xml setup.cfg, setup.py files
project(my_robot_controller) contains all the nodes.py files as well as __pyache and __init that we dont touch 
resource and test shouldnt be touched at this point either
package.xml  has dependables in it, their list needs to be appended each time a new node is created. 
dont touch setup.cfg
setup.py contrains some version info and most importantly a list of entry points that need to be appended when a new node is added. 

Class <Name>(Node): 				creates a subclass of the node class
	def__init__(self):   			is used to initialise an object of the class
		super().__init__("<Name>") 	gives a name to the object of the class
		...
		
def main(args = None):     		main function that runs when the .py file is called 
	rclpy.init(args = args)     	initiates the function 
	node = <Node Name>()    	initiates the node defined outside the main function
	rclpy.spin(node) 		makes the node run forever in the terminal 
	rclpy.shutdown()		kills the node

Plan : 
Finish tutorial series 
Find a way to have a publisher node on pi and a subscriber node on desktop 
Choosing a network structure:
1) fast reliable connection
2) internet connection to download packages
3) some degree of control to set up static IPs 
Access point network (AP_Net)
- 1 device broadcasts its own network , other devices connect (need another wifi dongle?)
- takes effort to configure
- stuck wit a base section
A dedicated network (travel router)
- connect all devices to a dedicated network 

For now, the phone will be used as a source of internet through cable and the raspberry pi will be tethered to desktop via an ssh bridge

Acomplishments:
reinstalled an older version of ubuntu on Pi since ROS2 does not support the newest one
Learned how to use Terminator
Downloaded ros2 simulation packages for lidar but had no time to test them
Connected raspberry pi to desktop 
finished the ROS2 humble tutorial series, understood nodes, topics, publishers, subscribers and services as well as created example code in my_robot project that shows how to interconnect them. 
Additional commands to discover topics and their contents have been appended to the terminal commands
